**Sovereignty Through Infrastructure** — A modular, open-source operating system for decentralized energy harvesting, data independence, and Universal Basic Ownership.

---

## 🎯 The Vision

We face two converging crises:

1. **The 92 Gigawatt Gap** — Eric Schmidt testified that AI infrastructure needs 92 additional gigawatts of power. That's 92 nuclear plants. Traditional builds take 8-12 years.

2. **AI Displacement** — 40-60% of jobs will be displaced by AI. The proposed solution is Universal Basic Income — government checks forever, permanent dependency.

**Quantum Oasis offers a different path: Universal Basic Ownership (UBO)**

Instead of dependency, we give people infrastructure they own that generates income 24/7. Energy sovereignty. Data sovereignty. Economic sovereignty.

## ⚡ Features

### Fear Box
Real-time grid stress visualization showing how AI datacenter demand pushes infrastructure toward collapse.

### Oasis Forge
Configure your personal sovereignty node:
- Choose platform (van, truck, trailer, stationary)
- Configure TEG units, solar, battery, mesh networking
- See cost, monthly revenue, and payback period

### Maggie.ai
Therapeutic AI companion with Quantum Oasis knowledge base. Born from 20 years of experience with non-verbal individuals.

### Modular Architecture
Add only what you need:
- **The Oasis** — Core energy harvesting
- **Shadow** — Research/OSINT tool
- **Friction-Free** — Blockchain music streaming
- **SynWave Studio** — Zero-latency collaboration
- **WeTube** — Decentralized video
- **LLM Pipeline** — Local AI training

## 🛠 Technology

### Multi-Source Energy Harvesting
- **Thermoelectric Generators (TEGs)** — Waste heat → electricity
- **Piezoelectric Systems** — Vibration → electricity
- **Solar Integration** — Flexible CIGS panels
- **RF Harvesting** — Ambient radio frequencies

### Technical Validation
- **University of Rochester (2025)** — Published 15x efficiency improvement for solar thermoelectric generation
- **Base Power** — $4B valuation validates distributed energy infrastructure market
- **Three USPTO Patents Pending** — Covering thermoelectric integration, mesh networking, multi-source harvesting
